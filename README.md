<h1>Birthday Blast! The Greatest NES Demo About Bombs and Birthdays Made in April 2023 (I hope!)</h1>

This is a fully functional demo of my first NES game, Birthday Blast! I made this for a class in University - it was actually a class on web development (with a focus on learning JavaScript programming), and every student is required to build a website. So I decided to build a website on ASM6502 programming (the assembly language used to code for the NES). The end result was a few demo programs (all available on my github), and this game in particular.

<h1>"Why did you learn an entire programming language (and a difficult one, at that) just to make a website? Are you crazy?</h1>

Probably not. But I wanted to learn how to program for the NES anyway, so I thought I'd "hack" my time and kill two birds with one stone, so to speak. Yes, it was more work, but it was ultimately more rewarding, too.

<h1>How to Learn From Birthday Blast</h1>
If you're fairly new to programming NES/ASM 6502, you may want to start with my other demo programs:
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/thomaslantern/nes-hello-world</li>
<li>https://github.com/thomaslantern/nes-basic-graphics</li>
<li>https://github.com/thomaslantern/nes-basic-sound</li>
<li>https://github.com/thomaslantern/nes-basic-controls</li>
</ul>

If you've gone through those tutorials (welcome back!), you're now ready for the epicness of Birthday Blast. So what now? Is there more to learn from this series? You bet! While Birthday Blast does build from its predecessors above, it combines their code and adds a few new subroutines. Here's a brief list of new additions that can't be found in the other tutorials:
<ul>
<li>Falling Bombs/li>
<li>Colourful Explosions (ooh!)</li>
<li>Score, Lives, and the Thrill of a Virtual Near-Death Experience (awesome!)</li>
<li>Code that probably isn't optimized, cleverly disguised as a challenge to the reader (that's you!)</li>
</ul>
